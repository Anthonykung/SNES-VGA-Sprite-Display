    <h2 class="anthonian-h2">Thanks for using SNES VGA Sprite Display Version 4.0</h2>
    <p class="anthonian-p">
      Let's see if we can help you out! Here's some of the documentations on how to use this package.
    </p>
    <h2 class="anthonian-h2">How To Use</h2>
    <p class="anthonian-p anthonian-side-margin">
      There are two folders in this package, Project HDL Files and Simulation Do Files. The Project HDL Files contains
      the actual HDL files for the package in both SystemVerilog and Verilog format. The Simulation Do Files contains
      the ModelSim simulation commands that you can use to simulate this package easily. The process of doing both are
      different, below are the different process of using this package.
    </p>
    <h3 class="anthonian-h3">Quartus</h3>
    <p class="anthonian-p anthonian-side-margin">
      For implementing on Quartus, load everything in the Project HDL Files folder to Quartus. Open VGA_Display.v in
      Quartus, create a symbol file for it. Go on to your top level schematic file (if you do not have one, you will
      need to create a new schematic file) and place the VGA_Display block in, be sure to connect all the ports to
      your inputs and outputs, outputs are the VGA ports on your FPGA.
    </p>
    <h3 class="anthonian-h3">ModelSim</h3>
    <p class="anthonian-p anthonian-side-margin">
      For simulation, load the .sv and .v files from the Project HDL Files into ModelSim ONLY, adding other files may
      cause errors. Your ModelSim Default Library Name should be named EXACTLY <code class="anthonian-code">work</code>. Go to Simulation Do Files and
      select the component you want to test. Copy the full file path, go back to ModelSim at the command bar, type
      <br />
      <code class="anthonian-code">do /path/to/folder/Simulation\ Do\ Files/Selected_Component.do</code>
